# MirkTech

This repository contains small projects for learning and/or training my own understanding of varies technologies.

Previously, I have made most of my demos in smaller projects, which may or may not have reached a git repository. Some work has been lost, since I never thought I would use it again; therefore, I will try to make this my go-to project for demoing :)
